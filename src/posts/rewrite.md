## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal site, where the magic happens! After a series of experiments that left the site a bit messy, I've completely rewritten it from the ground up, now featuring a sleek and minimalist user interface and experience.

## Issues with the Old Version

The previous version of the website had three glaring issues:

- Aesthetics
- Performance
- Accessibility

Aesthetically, the old design fell short, with its pastel colors that didn't quite fit a website. But fear not!

I've adopted a [Shadcn-like theme](https://shadcn.com), resulting in the following themes:

- AMOLED Dark
- Carbon Light (no, this isn't inspired by Shadcn's site, yet.)

Additionally, I've redesigned the logo into a simple SVG circle. Using this as my favicon significantly reduces load times, and I no longer need to worry about AVIF and WebP formats!

In performance, I've focused on minimalism, resulting in substantial reductions in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and image files. The website now loads blazingly fast!

As for accessibility, I've dedicated substantial time to improving it. However, there's one challenge:

- The lack of accessibility testing tools.

If you come across any accessibility issues, please open a GitHub issue!

## Upcoming Changes

Now, I have no specific plans. I may make occasional fixes and perhaps explore redesigns. Stay tuned!
