## What?

Hey! I'm [asyncedd](https://github.com/asyncedd), and I'm a professional [cinnamon roll cooker](https://asyncedd.github.io/cinnamon-roll-recipe) from Japan... I guess.

## Who are you?

Welp, jokes aside, I'm a hobbyist.  
I tell people I have no hobbies - I'd like to think so but- I don't know what are my hobbies. So, I assume I don't have hobbies. ðŸ˜…

I really like making cool stuff - Linux rices being one of them (they're harmfully addicting!).  
And on the other hand, I usually don't get myself to do the cool stuffs, unless I push myself - doing so.
Also, I'm **REALLY BAD** at muti-tasking - well, atleast multi-tasking consciously.

As you might tell from the structure of the "sentences", I'm really bad at sorting things and being organized. I don't think I'll ever be.  
On the meantime, I just force myself to organize things, usually failing :(

## My dev env.

As I stated before, I use Linux â€” EndeavourOS to be exact. I use Neovim as my text editor of choice, and I have 4k+ lines of Lua in my [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/asyncedd/dots.nvim) (quick plug lol) - I've put wayyy to much time than I should've but for now I think it's pretty solid thus, I'm gradually decreasing the time I `cd` into `~/.config/nvim` (essentially not tweaking stop more often!!)

That should sum it up I think :D

## My tech stack

I am a front-end dev, since I don't go to the back, but the front ðŸ˜Ž  
Ok, sorry for my **awful** jokes. Let's try it again.

As I said before, I live in the front. I'm planning to look into the back. But, now I'm living in the front :P  
Anyhow, my current front-end tech stack is:

- Svelte
- Sveltekit
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- GitHub pages
